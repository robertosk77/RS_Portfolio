		<h2>About Me:</h2>
		<p>Hi, my name's Roberto Sanchez and I'm a programmer currently enrolled in the amazing Epicodus coding boot camp.  My favorite programming language is (currently) JavaScript, and I'm interested in learning more about the game development aspect of computer science.I have a Bachelor's in English Literature from Florida Atlantic University, and I have worked as a bartender, legal assistant, and teacher before making the career switch to coding. I want to invest in my future as a programmer so that I can one day build my own video games. If I'm not working on my code, you can probably find me out on a hike, watching basketball on TV, or playing with my cat. </p>
